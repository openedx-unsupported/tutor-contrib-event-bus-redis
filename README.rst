event-bus-redis plugin for `Tutor <https://docs.tutor.overhang.io>`__
===================================================================================

DEPRECATED AND ARCHIVED
-----------------------

This repository never went into use because it was overkill for just
managing a few settings. It is just an empty cookiecutter template.

There may be useful context for setting up a new plugin that handles
event bus configuration and consumer running for both redis and Kafka in the
bmtcril/add_kafka branch.


Installation
------------

::

    pip install git+https://github.com/openedx/tutor-contrib-event-bus-redis

Usage
-----

::

    tutor plugins enable event-bus-redis
